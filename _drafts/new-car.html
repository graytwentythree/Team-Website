excerpt: After a six-year run with the previous solar car, the team is returning to the American Solar Challenge with an entirely new vehicle in 2016!
---

<p>We recently announced that we have entered the 2016 American Solar Challenge, and with that we have one other announcement...</p>

<p>It has been nearly six years since the team has entered an entirely new solar car in an event, but that's going to change in 2016. Officially known as Sunseeker 2016, the car has been designed with both the American and World solar challenges in mind, and will be a huge improvement over the <a href="{{ "/our-cars/2010" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2010 car</a> in many regards.</p>

<h2>What's new for Sunseeker 2016?</h2>

<p>When you look at a picture of the 2016 car, some of the differences between it and the 2010 car are obvious, however some are not. Most obvious of the differences, is the layout of the 2016 car. The layout includes the addition of a fourth wheel, we've added a fourth wheel to this car so that it will meet the World Solar Challenge regulations in that regard.</p>

<p>Of the differences which are not obvious, the following arei included: custom rims, rear wheel drive, driver seating position, and the physical dimensions of the car.</p>

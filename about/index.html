  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <p>The history of our team goes back to 1990, when a group of students from Western Michigan University set out to design, build, and compete with the first Sunseeker solar car. Their goal: to enhance our understanding of renewable energy and to make renewable energy sources more viable for powering the future. This same goal is in mind when the current generation of Sunseekers sets out to do the same.</p>
  <p>We have participated in all of the American Solar Challenge races since they began over 20 years ago. Throughout the years, we have <em>rayced</em> with various cars, all of which have been designed and built by students at Western Michigan University.</p>

  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>Every other summer we participate in the American Solar Challenge, ASC for short. Here's an excerpt from the challenge's website describing it in detail.</p>
  <blockquote>The American Solar Challenge (ASC) is a multi-day, 1200-1800 mile cross-country road race across North America. The event is typically held every other year during the summer and is open to solar car teams from countries all over the world. The routes have varied greatly over the course of the eventâ€™s rich history, but they are always designed to provide teams with a great opportunity to demonstrate their solar cars under real world driving conditions and thoroughly test the reliability of all onboard systems.</blockquote>
  <p>More about the American Solar Challenge can be found on its <a href="http://americansolarchallenge.org/" target="_blank">official website</a>, including results from past events.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Aside from designing, building, and competing with our solar cars, we have another important goal we want to accomplish. It goes back to the original reason the team was formed, to further our understanding of renewable energy. We want to raise awareness of clean, renewable energy sources by demonstrating our solar car, and engaging with the community to show how we can get so much from what is all around us.</p>
  <p>Throughout a calendar year, we attend numerous public events at which we display at least one of our cars. If you are interested in seeing one (possibly more) of the cars in person, follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SunseekerSolarCar" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/wmusunseeker" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for updates regarding where we will be and when.</p>
